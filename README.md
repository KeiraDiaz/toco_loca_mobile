### 1. Explain what are stateless widgets and stateful widgets, and explain the difference between them.
**Stateless Widgets**:
- Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning their properties cannot change once they are built. They are suitable for UI components that do not require any updates or changes after their creation.
- Examples include static text, icons, and simple layouts.

**Stateful Widgets**:
- Stateful widgets are mutable and can change their state during the lifetime of the widget. They maintain a state object that holds data that can be updated, causing the widget to rebuild when necessary.
- Examples include interactive components like checkboxes, text fields, or any widget that responds to user input.

**Key Difference**:
- The primary difference is that stateless widgets cannot change their state or re-render based on user actions, whereas stateful widgets can change and reflect those changes in the UI.

### 2. Mention the widgets that you have used for this project and its uses.
In your project, the following widgets have been used:

- **Scaffold**: Provides a structure for the visual interface, including an AppBar and a body area.
- **AppBar**: Displays a material design app bar at the top of the screen with a title.
- **Column**: Lays out its children in a vertical array, allowing for a stacked layout of widgets.
- **Row**: Arranges its children horizontally, which is used for displaying info cards side by side.
- **InfoCard**: A custom stateless widget used to display static information (NPM, Name, Class).
- **GridView**: Displays a grid of items that scrolls vertically, used for displaying the list of actions (product list, add product, logout).
- **Card**: Provides a material design card layout for the `InfoCard` widget to give it a raised effect.
- **InkWell**: A material design widget that responds to touch events, used for creating tappable areas in `ItemCard`.
- **SnackBar**: A lightweight message at the bottom of the screen that shows feedback when an action occurs (like pressing a button).
  
### 3. What is the use-case for `setState()`? Explain the variable that can be affected by `setState()`.
In this project, the use of `setState()` isn't explicitly present because your `MyHomePage` class is stateless. However, in a stateful widget context, `setState()` is used to notify the Flutter framework that the internal state of a widget has changed, and the framework should rebuild the widget.

**Use Case**:
- When a user interacts with the app (for instance, pressing a button that changes some data), `setState()` would be called to update the UI with the new state.

**Affected Variables**:
- Any variable defined in the state class of a stateful widget can be affected by `setState()`. For example, if you had a `bool isLoading` variable to indicate loading status, you would update this variable inside `setState()` whenever the loading state changes.

### 4. Explain the difference between `const` and `final` keyword.
- **const**:
  - `const` is used for compile-time constants. When you declare a variable with `const`, it is immutable, and its value is determined at compile time. 
  - Example: `const Text('Hello World')` creates a text widget that never changes.

- **final**:
  - `final` is used for variables that can only be assigned once but can be set at runtime. The value can be determined when the variable is initialized and can be any expression that resolves to a single value.
  - Example: `final String greeting = 'Hello World';` means that `greeting` can be assigned a value once, but that value can be determined at runtime.
In summary, use `const` when you want a constant value known at compile time, and use `final` when you want a variable whose value is set once at runtime but can be calculated based on other factors.

## 5. Implementing To Do List

Sure! Here‚Äôs a simplified summary of the project reorganization and widget creation steps:

### Reorganizing the Project Structure

1. **Create `menu.dart`:**
   - Create a new file named `menu.dart` in the `lib` directory.
   - Add the import statement:  
     ```dart
     import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
     ```

2. **Move Classes to `menu.dart`:**
   - Cut `MyHomePage` and `_MyHomePageState` classes from `main.dart` and paste them into `menu.dart`.

3. **Fix Import in `main.dart`:**
   - Add this import at the top of `main.dart` to resolve errors:
     ```dart
     import 'package:mental_health_tracker/menu.dart';
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Run the project to ensure everything works correctly.

### Creating a Simple Widget in Flutter

**Step 1: Change Application Theme Color**
- In `main.dart`, update the theme color:
  ```
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
      primarySwatch: Colors.deepPurple,
  ).copyWith(secondary: Colors.deepPurple[400]),
  ```

**Step 2: Convert `MyHomePage` to Stateless**
- In `main.dart`, change:
  ```
  home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
  ```
  to:
  ```
  home: MyHomePage(),
  ```

- In `menu.dart`, change `MyHomePage` to a stateless widget:
  ```
  class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
      MyHomePage({super.key});
      ...
  }
  ```

**Step 3: Create InfoCard Class**
- Declare variables in `MyHomePage`:
  ```
  final String npm = '5000000000'; // NPM
  final String name = 'Gedagedi Gedagedago'; // Name
  final String className = 'PBP S'; // Class
  ```

- Create `InfoCard` class:
  ```
  class InfoCard extends StatelessWidget {
      final String title;
      final String content;
      const InfoCard({super.key, required this.title, required this.content});
      ...
  }
  ```

**Step 4: Create ItemHomepage Class and ItemCard**
- Create `ItemHomepage` class:
  ```
  class ItemHomepage {
      final String name;
      final IconData icon;
      ItemHomepage(this.name, this.icon);
  }
  ```

- Define a list of items:
  ```
  final List<ItemHomepage> items = [
      ItemHomepage("View Mood", Icons.mood),
      ItemHomepage("Add Mood", Icons.add),
      ItemHomepage("Logout", Icons.logout),
  ];
  ```

- Create `ItemCard` class:
  ```
  class ItemCard extends StatelessWidget {
      final ItemHomepage item;
      const ItemCard(this.item, {super.key});
      ...
  }
  ```

**Step 5: Integrate InfoCard and ItemCard**
- Update the `build` method in `MyHomePage` to display `InfoCard` and `ItemCard`:
  ```
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Mental Health Tracker')),
          body: Padding(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
              child: Column(
                  children: [
                      Row(
                          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                          children: [
                              InfoCard(title: 'NPM', content: npm),
                              InfoCard(title: 'Name', content: name),
                              InfoCard(title: 'Class', content: className),
                          ],
                      ),
                      GridView.count(
                          crossAxisCount: 3,
                          shrinkWrap: true,
                          children: items.map((item) => ItemCard(item)).toList(),
                      ),
                  ],
              ),
          ),
      );
  }
  ```

**Final Step: Analyze the Project
- Run the command in the terminal to check for issues:
  ```bash
  flutter analyze
  ```

### 1. **Purpose and Advantages of `const` in Flutter**
   In Flutter, `const` is used to indicate that a value is compile-time constant, meaning it does not change. Using `const` has several benefits:
   
   - **Performance Optimization**: `const` widgets are instantiated only once, as they are immutable. This reduces the number of widget rebuilds, making the app more efficient.
   - **Less Memory Usage**: `const` values are stored only once in memory, which can lower the memory footprint of the app.
   - **Enhanced Readability**: Using `const` clarifies that certain elements do not need to be rebuilt, which can make the code easier to follow.

   **When to Use `const`**:
   - Use `const` for widgets and values that are guaranteed not to change.
   - Place `const` in front of widgets that do not depend on external data, such as static text, icons, or shapes.

   **When Not to Use `const`**:
   - Avoid using `const` for widgets that rely on dynamic values or are updated based on user interactions.

---

### 2. **Comparison of `Column` and `Row` Widgets in Flutter**

   The `Column` and `Row` widgets are used to arrange children in a vertical and horizontal layout, respectively.

   - **Column**: Displays widgets vertically.
     - **Usage**: When stacking widgets on top of each other.
     - **Properties**:
       - `mainAxisAlignment`: Controls the vertical alignment.
       - `crossAxisAlignment`: Controls the horizontal alignment.

     ```dart
     Column(
       mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
       crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
       children: [
         Text("Hello"),
         Icon(Icons.star),
         ElevatedButton(onPressed: () {}, child: Text("Press"))
       ],
     )
     ```

   - **Row**: Displays widgets horizontally.
     - **Usage**: When aligning widgets side-by-side.
     - **Properties**:
       - `mainAxisAlignment`: Controls the horizontal alignment.
       - `crossAxisAlignment`: Controls the vertical alignment.

     ```dart
     Row(
       mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceAround,
       crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
       children: [
         Icon(Icons.home),
         Text("Welcome"),
         Icon(Icons.settings),
       ],
     )
     ```

   **Key Difference**:
   - `Column` arranges widgets vertically, whereas `Row` arranges them horizontally.
   - Both allow for alignment customization but with different axis configurations.

### 3. **Input Elements Used and Other Potential Input Elements in Flutter**

   **Used Input Elements**:
   - **TextField**: For single-line text input.
   - **DropdownButton**: To provide a list of selectable options.
   - **Checkbox**: For selecting multiple options in a checklist style.
   - **RadioButton**: To select one option among several choices.
   - **Switch**: A toggle for binary choices (e.g., On/Off).
   - **Slider**: For selecting a value within a range.

   **Other Flutter Input Elements Not Used**:
   - **DatePicker**: Allows users to select a date from a calendar.
   - **TimePicker**: Provides a clock interface for selecting a time.
   - **Autocomplete**: Suggests options based on user input.
   - **Stepper**: Used for displaying a sequence of steps (e.g., multi-step form).

   Flutter‚Äôs input widgets provide versatility, each serving a different type of user input, so choosing the right one depends on the specific data required.

---

### 4. **Setting Theme in a Flutter Application**

   In Flutter, themes help ensure a consistent look and feel across the app by defining color schemes, font styles, and widget appearances.

   **Setting a Theme**:
   - Themes can be set globally using the `MaterialApp` widget‚Äôs `theme` property. The theme is defined in `ThemeData`, where properties like colors, text styles, and button themes can be customized.
   - Example of defining a light theme with custom colors:

     ```dart
     MaterialApp(
       theme: ThemeData(
         primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
         accentColor: Colors.amber,
         textTheme: TextTheme(
           bodyText1: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, color: Colors.black),
         ),
       ),
       home: HomePage(),
     );
     ```

   **Customizing Theme**:
   - You can add a `ThemeData.dark()` for dark mode and toggle between light and dark themes based on user preference.

   **Implemented Theme**:
   - If you implemented a theme, it likely included `ThemeData` to define a consistent color scheme and text styling.

### 5. **Managing Navigation in a Multi-Page Flutter Application**

   Flutter offers multiple ways to navigate between pages:

   - **Navigator.push and Navigator.pop**: The most basic form of navigation, where you push a new route (page) onto the stack and pop it to go back.
     ```dart
     // Navigating to a new page
     Navigator.push(
       context,
       MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => NewPage()),
     );

     // Going back to the previous page
     Navigator.pop(context);
     ```

   - **Named Routes**: Useful for organizing navigation in larger apps by defining routes in `MaterialApp`‚Äôs `routes` property. Named routes improve readability and reusability.
     ```dart
     MaterialApp(
       initialRoute: '/',
       routes: {
         '/': (context) => HomePage(),
         '/settings': (context) => SettingsPage(),
       },
     );

     // Navigate to the settings page
     Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/settings');
     ```

   - **Navigation with Libraries**: For complex navigation scenarios, libraries like `go_router` or `auto_route` are often used to simplify and streamline routing.

   Managing navigation well enhances the user experience and makes the app flow more intuitive, especially when handling back navigation and transitions between related screens.

### 1. **Why do we need to create a model to retrieve or send JSON data? Will an error occur if we don‚Äôt create a model first?**

A **model** for JSON data simplifies data parsing and ensures data consistency. Here's why it's important:

- **Type Safety**: A model defines the expected structure and types of data, helping avoid runtime errors caused by unexpected or incorrect data.
- **Ease of Use**: Using models allows you to work with structured data (e.g., objects) instead of raw JSON, making your code easier to read and maintain.
- **Validation**: A model can include validation rules to ensure data integrity before sending or after receiving it.
  
If you don‚Äôt create a model:
- **Errors won‚Äôt necessarily occur**, but you‚Äôll have to work with raw JSON, which is error-prone and less maintainable.
- **Parsing and validation** will have to be done manually, increasing the likelihood of bugs and making code harder to manage.

### 2. **Function of the HTTP library in this task**

The **HTTP library** in Flutter is used for making network requests. Key functionalities include:
- **GET Requests**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST Requests**: Send data to a server (e.g., for creating or updating resources).
- **Header Management**: Add authentication tokens or content-type headers.
- **Response Handling**: Parse server responses, such as JSON payloads, for use in the application.

For this task, the HTTP library facilitates communication between the Flutter app and the backend API.

---

### 3. **Function of `CookieRequest`**

`CookieRequest` is used to handle session-based authentication in Flutter. Its primary functions are:
- **Maintaining Session State**: It stores cookies (e.g., session ID) sent by the server, allowing the app to stay logged in across multiple requests.
- **Automatic Cookie Management**: It automatically attaches the stored cookies to subsequent requests, ensuring authenticated requests.
- **Centralized Access**: Sharing the `CookieRequest` instance with all components ensures that all parts of the app share the same session state.

This shared instance is necessary to provide a consistent user experience and manage session persistence across the app.

---

### 4. **Mechanism of Data Transmission (Input to Display)**

1. **Input in Flutter**: User inputs data via forms or other widgets.
2. **Data Conversion**: Data is converted into a JSON format or query parameters to send to the server.
3. **HTTP Request**: The Flutter app sends the data (e.g., using `http.post`) to the backend.
4. **Backend Processing**: The server processes the request (e.g., validates input, performs CRUD operations on the database).
5. **Response from Backend**: The server sends a response in JSON format containing the required data.
6. **Data Parsing**: The Flutter app receives the response and parses it (often using models).
7. **UI Update**: The parsed data is displayed in widgets like `ListView` or `Text`.

---

### 5. **Authentication Mechanism**

#### **Login**
1. **Input**: User enters username and password in Flutter.
2. **Request**: Flutter sends a POST request with the credentials to the Django backend (e.g., `/login/` endpoint).
3. **Validation**: Django validates the credentials:
   - If valid, it creates a session and returns session cookies or a token.
   - If invalid, it returns an error response.
4. **Response**: Flutter saves the session data (e.g., in `CookieRequest` or a token store) and navigates to the menu screen.

#### **Register**
1. **Input**: User enters registration details (e.g., name, email, password).
2. **Request**: Flutter sends a POST request to Django‚Äôs registration endpoint (e.g., `/register/`).
3. **Backend**: Django:
   - Validates the input.
   - Creates a new user in the database.
   - Optionally logs the user in or sends a confirmation response.
4. **Response**: Flutter receives the response and either logs the user in or displays success.

#### **Logout**
1. **Request**: Flutter sends a request to Django‚Äôs logout endpoint (e.g., `/logout/`).
2. **Backend**: Django clears the session or invalidates the token.
3. **Response**: Flutter removes the session or token data and navigates to the login screen.

#### **Display of Menu**
1. **Session Validation**: On navigating to the menu, Flutter checks session validity (e.g., using `CookieRequest`).
2. **Data Fetching**: Flutter fetches menu data (e.g., user details or items) from Django.
3. **Response Handling**: Data is parsed and displayed using Flutter widgets.

This flow ensures secure authentication and seamless user experience.

### Implementation of the Checklist Step by Step

1. **Deploying the Django Project on Localhost**
   - Set up a Django project and configure it with a PostgreSQL or SQLite database.
   - Create required models, views, and APIs for authentication and item management.
   - Use Django REST Framework (DRF) to create JSON endpoints for items.
   - Run the Django development server on localhost to ensure smooth functionality.

2. **Implementing the Registration Feature in Flutter**
   - Create a registration page using `TextField` widgets for user input (e.g., username, email, and password).
   - Add a submit button that triggers an HTTP POST request to the Django `/register/` endpoint.
   - Parse the server response to provide feedback (success or failure) to the user.

3. **Creating a Login Page in Flutter**
   - Build a login page with input fields for username and password.
   - Use the HTTP library to send a POST request to Django‚Äôs `/login/` endpoint.
   - If login is successful, store the session data or token using `CookieRequest`.

4. **Integrating Django Authentication with Flutter**
   - Use `CookieRequest` in Flutter to store cookies or tokens received from Django.
   - Ensure the session or token is attached to all requests requiring authentication (e.g., fetching user-specific items).
   - Implement session validation logic in Flutter to handle scenarios like expired sessions.

5. **Creating a Custom Model in Django**
   - Define a model in Django for items with attributes like `name`, `price`, `description`, and `user` (ForeignKey to the `User` model).
   - Migrate the model to the database using `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.

6. **Creating the Item List Page in Flutter**
   - Use `FutureBuilder` to fetch JSON data from Django's `/items/` endpoint.
   - Parse the JSON response into a custom Dart model.
   - Display the list using `ListView.builder`, showing the name, price, and description for each item.

7. **Creating a Detail Page for Items**
   - Add navigation to the detail page when a user taps an item on the list.
   - Pass the selected item's data to the detail page using `Navigator.push`.
   - Display all item attributes on this page using widgets like `Text` and `Column`.
   - Include a button to navigate back to the list page.

8. **Filtering the Item List for the Logged-in User**
   - Modify the Django endpoint to return only items associated with the currently authenticated user.
   - On the Flutter side, ensure the authentication token or session is included in the request headers for this endpoint.

9. **README Documentation**
   - Write a detailed README explaining:
     - Each step in implementing the checklist.
     - Any challenges faced and solutions.
     - The structure of the Django and Flutter projects, including API endpoints and models.
     - Answers to the provided questions with clear subheadings.
